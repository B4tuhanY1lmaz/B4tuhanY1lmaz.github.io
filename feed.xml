It actually started really well and I really wished saying the same thing for ending too. 
I met lot’s of good people in that time and of course I had some people that I wished to never met (Yes I’m talking about you Mis. Pekdemir. FUCK YOU!) and had a great time with them. Having that plandemic and being stuck at home for 1.5 years has took so moch stuff from us but the rest of the 2.5 years were great times an I’m happy becouse it happened and I’m sorry becouse it come to an end.</p>

<p>But as always we grown up and time passes and now it’s time to be productive, make money and escape matrix like Andrew Tate did lol.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-im-gonna-do-now">So what I’m gonna do now?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Answer for that question is actually depended so much on which collage I’ll go becouse I have 2 plans now.</li>
  <li>The Plan A is being an electrical engineer and have a carrier based on programming and other stuff.</li>
  <li>The plan B is studying graphical design and creating my own advertaising businness based on that.</li>
</ul>

<p>And much more like that but the thing I know is I’m gonna sucsess and won’t let anyone to take me down from the way I wanna go.</p>

<h2 id="acknowledge">Acknowledge</h2>
<p>I’m typing this for the everyone who has been with me since the beginning of this 4 year journey. You guys are awesome and I hope you all can live in the perfect life that you’re dreaming of. I also want to say a thank you to my English teacher Hatice İşler. Without her I wouldn’t be able to write this post in English or have the motivation to learn this language. She helped me and my friends a lot and I hope everything goes well on her side.</p>

I read lot’s of blogposts from random people and noticed that the much simpler the post gets the much understandable and readable it gets. Let’s talk about that.</p>

<h3 id="your-posts-should-be-summeraised">Your posts should be summeraised</h3>
<p>While reading these long posts from various writers I noticed that all of them was hiding their content under lot’s of uselles sentences and after some point that became for us readers to keep up with the post they’re reading and after some point that can keep readers away from your blog. You should keep your sentences and posts simple as possible and more focused on your topic.</p>

<h3 id="theming-of-your-site">Theming of your site</h3>
<p>Another mistake people do is they’re trying to keep their blogs minimal as possible by getting rid of any type of theme or text styling and that ends up with just a white page and some text on it with default font of your browser and that actually makes everything much harder. I know there is some suckless fans out there that enjoys their webpages with pure HTML on their favourite terminal web browser I’m perfectly fine with them but we don’t have to build our blogs for these people. A proper theme actually makes reading your content and navigating around your webpage much easier. 
If you’re using the default Jekyll theme, I suggest you to use one of these themes instead.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll">Mediumish</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes">Minimal-mistakes</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="split-your-content-into-different-paragraphs">Split your content into different paragraphs</h3>
<p>This is actually a mistake that I have done in the past. When writing your content make sure to split them into multiple paragraphs on right places. That actually makes reading and makes finding the thing you’re searching much easier. 1 huge paragraph with everything in one place keeps readers away from main focus of the content and results with your readers loss of the interest on your content. But splitting it into multiple paragraphs helps your reader to focus more and also makes more efficent to both write and read.</p>

<p>So this was it guys, I wanted to write down my own troughs about that and if you’re think that I’m wrong or I’m right you can always talk to me over e-mail or at Fosstodon. One of my friends is planning to start a blog for himself and to help him I’m planning to make a more detailed post about how you can create your own blog. Until next time.</p>

I’ve been using macOS Monterey on my Dell Optiplex 7050 using <a href="https://github.com/B4tuhanY1lmaz/Dell-Optiplex-7050-Hackintosh">OpenCore</a>” and everythig was smooth and worked in the way that they should. But after I lost my computers on earthquake and when got the new ones at the beginning of the May I decided to go with Linux and Ubuntu as the distro.</p>

<p>The reason I did go with Ubuntu becouse it’s been like 4 years since last time I installed and used Ubuntu on my daily driver and wanted to see how far it did come in that time. I know we have better alternatives like POP!, Debian and Linux Mint. I didn’t wanted to go with the first two becouse they were stable release distros and I’ve used Linux Mint recently before installing Fedora on my laptop and since I mentioned earlier I wanted to try something that I haven’t tried in a long time.</p>

<p>Also another reason is I’m going to start a carrier in videography and graphic design and the applications I’ve use like Kdelive, Blender, Inkspace, Krita and Figma Linux has first hand support for Ubuntu and this makes my life soo much easier in most considrable way.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/789025765055791104/1110147293337886720/Pasted_image_20230522130056.png" alt="Snap..." /></p>

<p>Only thing I hate about Ubuntu is it forces users to use their package format snap and even tho I use it to run Nextcloud and some other stuff on my server, I don’t like them in desktop application use becouse they’re slow as hell on a hard drive based system like my desktop and I’m looking for ways to remove it and when I find it I’ll make a post about it hopefully.</p>

Let’s talk about that.</p>

<p>I was considering switching over to another note taking platform dince the day they <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/16/23462444/evernote-acquired-mobile-developer-bending-spoons-2023">acquired by Bending Spoons</a> but I was paying for the Evernote Premium and actually it was great for me. The old price was 8 liras per month and it was like free. But later on <a href="https://evernote.com/blog/evernote-pricing-upcoming-features-update/">this update</a> has being posted on Evernote blog.</p>

<p>My subscription has jumped to 40 liras per month and it was a bit much for me. I know it isn’t much but I wasn’t fine with paying that much for an note taking app. The thing that was keeping me on Evernote was it’s note syncing feature and it’s old device support. I wasn’t even using the full features of the premium plan and if we consider the data they’re collecting from their users, that price jump was enough for me.</p>

<p>Than I began to search up on the internet for alternatives that I could host myself with my <a href="https://thebatuhansnetwork.xyz/recreating-optiplex-server/">new server</a> and I came across with 2 options. First one was using Obsidian.md with file syncing tools like <a href="https://www.resilio.com/">Resilio Sync</a> or <a href="https://syncthing.net/">SyncThing</a> and second one being paying for <a href="https://notesnook.com/">Noteshook</a>. 
Noteshook is an Evernote like open source note taking platform built with privacy in mind but it isn’t self hostable yet and their prices are almost same with Evernote.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Come on Batuhan it’s just <a href="https://kevquirk.com/it-only-costs-a-coffee-per-month">a coffee per month</a> and you’re supporting an open source app! Why not just pay for it?</li>
</ul>

<p>I can hear you saying that but I simply don’t want to pay for my note taking application even tho it just costs me a coffee per month. I prefer drinking a real coffee every month for that price.</p>

<p>And as you guess, I decided to use the <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian.md</a>. Obsidian.md is actually an offline note taking application without syncing out of the box. Unless you pay 8$ per month and their editor is very flexible and since it was free and doesn’t collects any data I decided to go with it.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/789025765055791104/1105939593850785823/Pasted_image_20230510181554.png" alt="This post on Obsidian" /></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>As you can see on top, this blogpost has written using Obsidians Linux client.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I had to find a way to sync my notes between my Laptop, desktop and phone. My first plan was using Syncthing for that but it’s lack of official iOS app was keeping me away from it so I decided to use Resilio Sync for that. I’ve installed it on all of my devices and after doing a simple configration all my notes were in sync with each other and I was happy with it.</p>

<p>I hope one day NotesHook becomes self hostable and I can use it freely on all of my devices. Becouse it has the UI and features that I get use of since the year 2018.</p>

<p>Syncthing over port 9000, XRDP over port 3386 and uptime kuma over port 8000 was stopped working and even tho I added them to UFW it shouldn’t be the problem right? Wrong! For some reason UFW was still blocking every single connection other than port 22 and 9090 and my only fix for it was disabling UFW.</p>

<p>Disabling it fixed my problems instantly and I was happy becouse I was able to get my stuff up and running. But the problem now I don’t have any firewalls securing my server. And I think I’ll go that way but it isn’t secure. But even tho this isn’t a secure way to do that, this server doesn’t actually open to world wide web other than tailscale network and my blog is being hosted using Cloudflare Tunnel and it doesn’t directly opens my port 80 to open web.</p>

<p>So I think it’s safe to say that I’m still secure with my setup and since I don’t have any directly open ports. It isn’t possible to have an attack on my server unless some malicious device pops up on tailscale.</p>

Before creating it I planned my use cases.</p>
<ol>
  <li>A webserver inside a Debian VM</li>
  <li>A Nextcloud server inside Ubuntu Server 22.04 VM</li>
  <li>SMB server for file sharing on local</li>
  <li>A Minecraft server running bare metal</li>
  <li>And some tiny services like dashy and uptime kuma inside a Arch VM. (I use arch btw)
These were the summary of things I planned to run on this server. So for that I needed to find the perfect OS for it. What I mean by that is, it should be optimized for virtualisation and it should be stable. And for these reasons I decided to go with Rocky Linux 9.1. I went their website, downloaded iso, burned using balenaEtcher and step 1 was completed. !<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/789025765055791104/1105173951015035091/DBBB546C-E464-4A43-95F2-9B06204311BA.png" alt="etcher" /></li>
</ol>

<p>Step 2 was finding an suitable OS drive. 
At the beginning I considered using a USB3.0 32GB USB stick but than I saw that these usb sticks were good at storing files but not at randomly accsesing them. I tried installing Debian onto this 32GB Kioxia USB 3.0 stick and it ran slow as hell. And becouse of that I decided to go with an SSD and I brought out a 240GB Crucial BX500 for that !<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/789025765055791104/1105173950578835566/A959E34E-8708-4BBC-ACF6-8079C1D5F5CB.jpeg" alt="SSD and Optiplex server" />
I preferred this SSD becouse it was my best option for it’s price. Thing makes this SSD better is it’s dram. Dram is important for random acsessing the data on drive and since I’m gonna run bunch of different virtual machines on it at the same time, it’s a feature that I need. Also when compared to it’s dramless same priced alternatives like WD Green. 
After installing Rocky Linux 9 I greeted with the beautiful Gnome 40 desktop and it was ready to go. All things I needed (QEMU, Virt-Manager, Cockpit, HTTPD, OpenSSL, Samba) was installed upon installation since I selected them and only thing I needed to do was condfiguring them.</p>

<h2 id="configration">Configration</h2>
<p>My another reason for going with Rocky Linux was using terminal minimal as possible. Becouse since this OS is designed to be fast, production ready and easy to use I wanted to done most of the configration like users and samba shares over at Cockpit webui and for that I installed the cockpit-shares and cockpit-identification plugins and I’ve done configuring Samba without entering a single command. But of course when it comes to other parts such as setting up the Debian VM and other stuff I needed command line and here comes it.</p>

<h3 id="debian-vm">Debian VM</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>A webserver inside a Debian VM 
<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/789025765055791104/1105173951476416616/Screenshot_2023-05-07_at_22.34.03.png" alt="CockpitUI" />
As you can see on top I’ve created a tiny VM and it’s been serving as my webserver since the day I posted <a href="https://thebatuhansnetwork.xyz/the-page-you-currently-in/">this post</a> and you’re proably reading this from that virtual machine too.
<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/789025765055791104/1105173951749038230/Screenshot_2023-05-07_at_22.35.18.png" alt="Htop" /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see only 84MB of ram usage! While setting this VM up I’ve gone with less things installed as possible and when the setup has finished I had a very simple OS with base system and nothing more. Than I installed some stuff I needed for Jekyll ,apache2 and openssh-server becouse ssh doesn’t uses too much memory and it’s just easier for me to ssh in instead of opening a VNC client and connecting to VM. Since it doesn’t has a GUI. 
You may ask if this VM is that simple, what brings this website to me? Well answer is simple. It’s CloudFlare tunnel. I’ve installed it into servers itself and than created a Virtual network for this VM so it’s reachable from server and than I used it’s virtual IP and it worked! 
With that Crucial SSD booting this VM only takes a seconds and feels same as running a container.</p>

<h3 id="ubuntu-server">Ubuntu Server</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>A Nextcloud server inside Ubuntu Server 22.04 VM</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Configuring Ubuntu Server VM was very simple. I just used the Nextcloud Snap package for it and with sime tiny configrations it was done. I’m not actually a fan of snaps becouse they’re bloaed as hell and runs much slower when compared to it’s alternative Faltpaks but since this VMs only purpose is Nextcloud I’m completely fine with it. 
I gaved the same amount of resources expect sotrage and usage on this VM is way more than other one like 400Mb while idling but this was expected and even under load it doesn’t goes higher than 800Mbs and I’m happy with it.</p>

<h3 id="extras">Extras</h3>
<p>And I’ve installed some extras like Resillio Sync for file synchronising, Xrdp for be able to login to GUI remotely and autoSSH for port forwarding to a VPS.</p>

<p>In a summary this was it guys. Of course things went more complicated and I tried to keep it simple. I’m planning to host myself a <a href="https://sr.ht/~tsileo/microblog.pub/">microblog.pub</a> instance like <a href="https://qrk.social/">Kev Quirk</a> and a <a href="https://sr.ht/~thecashewtrader/minv/">minv</a>
server but for now I don’t have enough time to do these but when I do I’m gonna keep you guys updated about it. If you have any questions or need support for your server you can come and check out our <a href="https://discord.gg/5p27ZdzQzF">Discord server</a> .</p>

Today is 06 May 2023. Today is birthday of my girl bestfriend and I hope she’s having a great day but other than that. 3 months has passed since the earthquake happened. If you ask us. We’re doing completely well on that. We recreated our life in past 3 months and succeeded. We’re now in a safe and secure place. Everything is going great on it’s place. But the problem is they forgot it. Everyone expect people who affected by earthquake has already forgot what happened and everybody is focused on election. Just 2 month ago the earthquake was at the main focus of the politicans but now nobody talks about it. I watched the place I called as home collapsing. I watched the place I called home to became a graveyard for more than 50k people just in seconds. I watched people to cry out becouse of their loved ones. Not the things or houses but people they called as home, people they called as family … and much more. They’re gone and no one is able to revive them. So what now? Are we gonna just forget them, are we gonna forget how they left people on their own, are we gonna forget survivors? Are we gonna forget people who is responsible for that? Are we gonna forget people who left us to death? Are we just gonna forget everything? Looks like we have to becouse everyone has forgot it and is there any reason to keep these memories alive?
Turkish people loves to forget and this time it didn’t take long for that to happen. But man a disaster like that … Last week I went to Malatya to see how people doing over there and seems like life on Malatya began to turn back to normal and everything going on it’s way but there is a one big problem. The landscape of this city we used to see isn’t there anymore. Without all these buildings and people who makes this city different isn’t there anymore and without them this place feels so strange to me. I used to call this place as home with everything and everyone inside but now. I’m a complete stranger to this place and I won’t be able to be part of Malatya anymore.</p>

<p>I hope this earthquake changes something over at people becouse I don’t want that to happen again and I don’t want to loose my home one more time.</p>

Today is 06 May 2023. Today is birthday of my girl bestfriend and I hope she’s having a great day but other than that. 3 months has passed since the earthquake happened. If you ask us. We’re doing completely well on that. We recreated our life in past 3 months and succeeded. We’re now in a safe and secure place. Everything is going great on it’s place. But the problem is they forgot it. Everyone expect people who affected by earthquake has already forgot what happened and everybody is focused on election. Just 2 month ago the earthquake was at the main focus of the politicans but now nobody talks about it. I watched the place I called as home collapsing. I watched the place I called home to became a graveyard for more than 50k people just in seconds. I watched people to cry out becouse of their loved ones. Not the things or houses but people they called as home, people they called as family … and much more. They’re gone and no one is able to revive them. So what now? Are we gonna just forget them, are we gonna forget how they left people on their own, are we gonna forget survivors? Are we gonna forget people who is responsible for that? Are we gonna forget people who left us to death? Are we just gonna forget everything? Looks like we have to becouse everyone has forgot it and is there any reason to keep these memories alive? Turkish people loves to forget and this time it didn’t take long for that to happen. But man a disaster like that … Last week I went to Malatya to see how people doing over there and seems like life on Malatya began to turn back to normal and everything going on it’s way but there is a one big problem. The landscape of this city we used to see isn’t there anymore. Without all these buildings and people who makes this city different isn’t there anymore and without them this place feels so strange to me. I used to call this place as home with everything and everyone inside but now. I’m a complete stranger to this place and I won’t be able to be part of Malatya anymore.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The page you’re currently in being hosted from a VM</title><link href="https://thebatuhansnetwork.xyz/the-page-you-currently-in/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The page you’re currently in being hosted from a VM" /><published>2023-05-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-05-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://thebatuhansnetwork.xyz/the-page-you-currently-in</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://thebatuhansnetwork.xyz/the-page-you-currently-in/"><![CDATA[<p>So today I got my new server and I’m gonna post it tomorrow and the page you’re currently in is being hosted from a tiny and minimal as hell Debian 11 virtual machine with only 16GB of storage and 1GB of ram.

<p>I actually wasn’t planning to get this phone. I was using my good old Galaxy Note 3 running Android 4.4.2 as my daily driver and I was happy with it.  Becouse only thing I needed was a minimal phone that gets my job done and runs everything I needed. But this is topic of another post and in future I’m planning to make a review on that phone but I’ve lost the one I had at the earthquake and now I have to find one in working condition which isn’t an easy task. But hopefully when I found one, I’ll make a post about it too. Enough talking lets start with 7 Plus.</p>

<h2 id="my-setup-and-usage">My Setup and usage:</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/789025765055791104/1102337116727414904/IMG_1976.PNG" alt="Homescreen" />
I have a single page setup with all the apps and widgets I need becouse I want to keep this phone minimal and less distractive as possible.

“Minimal and non distractive phone”
I mostly use this phone for note taking over Evernote, reading the latest from the RSS feeds I follow using the NetNewsWire, taking some good looking photos using Camera, editing them on Lightroom and uploading to my Nextcloud server and spending some free time over social media apps like Instagram [yes I do use instagram becouse all my friends do and it’s the only place where I could talk to them] and Mastodon. And it does all of these tasks great with no problems. But there is a optimization problem with the Evernote app and it needs to be fixed. What I mean by that, the app runs perfectly fine when it’s offline but it lags so bad when I try to type something while it’s online. I don’t know what is the reason of that but this problem only exists with the iPhone 7 Plus and I hope they’ll fix it as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="battery">Battery:</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/789025765055791104/1102337117767602277/IMG_1988.PNG" alt="" />
Given at it’s age, this phones battery isn’t in the best condition. It’s at %74 and sometimes leaves me at half a day. But most of the time I go outside, I do keep my wirelles connections like LTE, WiFi and Bluetooth and that helps battery to stay for the entire day with no problem.</p>

<h2 id="camera">Camera:</h2>
<p>Back in the August of 2016, when this phone has released. Dual camera of this phone was revolutionary. It was the first dual camera phone on the market and being able to shoot portrait photos with natural blur and video recording at 4k 30fps which was never seen on a mobile device like that before and created a very big hype that still controls the mobile phone market today. And I think that camera of this phone isn’t old yet and still be able to take great looking pictures under daylight. But when it comes to nighttime camera of this phone starts to struggle. Here is some photos I took with this phone to show the difference between daylight and nightlight.</p>
<h3 id="my-old-iphone-6-plus">My old iPhone 6 Plus</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/789025765055791104/1102338159678869605/IMG_0119.png" alt="Daylight with portrait on my hand" /> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/789025765055791104/1102338160614178909/IMG_0123.png" alt="Nightlight with portraint under a tree" /></p>

<h3 id="portraits">Portraits</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/789025765055791104/1102338158936465548/IMG_0091.png" alt="My friend Yusuf with portrait mode at daylight" /> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/789025765055791104/1102337939771494560/IMG_0332.png" alt="My tiny brother Doğukan with portrait at nightlight" />
As you can see from photos, light really creates a day and night difference both on portrait and normal photos. But I think that it does a better job than most of the 2016 phones under nightlight.</p>

<h2 id="final-troughs">Final troughs:</h2>
<p>So in the end, if you ask me that is this phone is still usable my answer is will be yes. Becouse since it haven’t lost it’s support yet every single app that you could think of still works perfectly fine over there and I never encountered any problems with the performance of this phone. So like if you want to get into Apple ecosystem and wanna start with something cheap or you need an iPhone for your little brother or an old member of your family so you can send iMessage or Facetime with them you can prefer this phone with no doubt. One of these on good condition like mine could last at least 4 years and I think that it’s enough for a phones life.</p>
