<p>I actually wasn’t planning to get this phone. I was using my good old Galaxy Note 3 running Android 4.4.2 as my daily driver and I was happy with it.  Becouse only thing I needed was a minimal phone that gets my job done and runs everything I needed. But this is topic of another post and in future I’m planning to make a review on that phone but I’ve lost the one I had at the earthquake and now I have to find one in working condition which isn’t an easy task. But hopefully when I found one, I’ll make a post about it too. Enough talking lets start with 7 Plus.</p>

<h2 id="my-setup-and-usage">My Setup and usage:</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/789025765055791104/1102337116727414904/IMG_1976.PNG" alt="Homescreen" />
I have a single page setup with all the apps and widgets I need becouse I want to keep this phone minimal and less distractive as possible.

“Minimal and non distractive phone”
I mostly use this phone for note taking over Evernote, reading the latest from the RSS feeds I follow using the NetNewsWire, taking some good looking photos using Camera, editing them on Lightroom and uploading to my Nextcloud server and spending some free time over social media apps like Instagram [yes I do use instagram becouse all my friends do and it’s the only place where I could talk to them] and Mastodon. And it does all of these tasks great with no problems. But there is a optimization problem with the Evernote app and it needs to be fixed. What I mean by that, the app runs perfectly fine when it’s offline but it lags so bad when I try to type something while it’s online. I don’t know what is the reason of that but this problem only exists with the iPhone 7 Plus and I hope they’ll fix it as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="battery">Battery:</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/789025765055791104/1102337117767602277/IMG_1988.PNG" alt="" />
Given at it’s age, this phones battery isn’t in the best condition. It’s at %74 and sometimes leaves me at half a day. But most of the time I go outside, I do keep my wirelles connections like LTE, WiFi and Bluetooth and that helps battery to stay for the entire day with no problem.</p>

<h2 id="camera">Camera:</h2>
<p>Back in the August of 2016, when this phone has released. Dual camera of this phone was revolutionary. It was the first dual camera phone on the market and being able to shoot portrait photos with natural blur and video recording at 4k 30fps which was never seen on a mobile device like that before and created a very big hype that still controls the mobile phone market today. And I think that camera of this phone isn’t old yet and still be able to take great looking pictures under daylight. But when it comes to nighttime camera of this phone starts to struggle. Here is some photos I took with this phone to show the difference between daylight and nightlight.</p>
<h3 id="my-old-iphone-6-plus">My old iPhone 6 Plus</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/789025765055791104/1102338159678869605/IMG_0119.png" alt="Daylight with portrait on my hand" /> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/789025765055791104/1102338160614178909/IMG_0123.png" alt="Nightlight with portraint under a tree" /></p>

<h3 id="portraits">Portraits</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/789025765055791104/1102338158936465548/IMG_0091.png" alt="My friend Yusuf with portrait mode at daylight" /> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/789025765055791104/1102337939771494560/IMG_0332.png" alt="My tiny brother Doğukan with portrait at nightlight" />
As you can see from photos, light really creates a day and night difference both on portrait and normal photos. But I think that it does a better job than most of the 2016 phones under nightlight.</p>

<h2 id="final-troughs">Final troughs:</h2>
<p>So in the end, if you ask me that is this phone is still usable my answer is will be yes. Becouse since it haven’t lost it’s support yet every single app that you could think of still works perfectly fine over there and I never encountered any problems with the performance of this phone. So like if you want to get into Apple ecosystem and wanna start with something cheap or you need an iPhone for your little brother or an old member of your family so you can send iMessage or Facetime with them you can prefer this phone with no doubt. One of these on good condition like mine could last at least 4 years and I think that it’s enough for a phones life.</p>

I was planning to reach to that milestone at the middle of the Febuary but as we all know, huge disasters has happened and recovering from that wasn’t an easy thing to do.</p>

<p>But yeah let’s throw the past away and continue from where we left of from. Becouse turning back to these days over and over again never helps and just makes recovering harder and harder.</p>

<p>Hopefully guys I’ll continue to write into my blog and we’ll reach to the 25th post, 50th post and as the end of this year the 100th post. Anyways guys thanks for reading. See you in the next post.</p>

It created lots of problems and I had to reverse it and now the site you’re currently in works from that HDD. Let’s hope into details.
The idea of doing this migration isn’t actually new. I had that idea since the day I got this server. Becouse Hdd of this server is an OEM Seagate Barracuda 80 GB drive from January of 2010 and at the time I got this server it had total of 38K hours of runtimes and 2 days ago this number was about to hit to the 39K. Actually drive works perfectly fine. I never encountered any problems with it. Since its most I/O tasks are done while the server boots and it just idles most of it’s uptimes. But since this drive is an 13 years old drive it just scares me. To fix that not existing problem I was thinking about doing a whole reinstall of the Debian 11 on that USB drive and start from fresh on my server which I already did 5 weeks ago lol. Than I gave up from that idea becouse reconfiguring things and most importantly the RAID 1 isn’t a thing I would like to do and for that I decided to clone the OS drive and continue from where I left before. But sonce I said earlier we aren’t living in the perfect awesome world and things always goes wrong.
The migration progress went perfectly fine. To do the migration I booted up my laptop and ssh’d into server, than used dd to create an image of the HDD and after getting the image I used the gzip to compress it. I used <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dd">this wiki page</a> as an referance on Ach wiki to do that. Please be carefull when using DD on your own machine.
After getting the image and compression progress is done. I copied the image to my Laptop using Nautilus (Yes I used a GUi program instead of scp command line. I don’t use Arch btw.) While the imaging the drive, I downloaded the Clonezilla-live and created a VM with it. After that I mounted my Ventoy USB, Clonezilla LiveCD, the USB drive I’m gonna use for the OS and the image I just got from my server into the virtual machine and booted it. Before migrating anything I had to do some changes on the image. Becouse the image was to big for my 32GB USB and that scares the clonezilla. For that I booted the Fedora 38 pre-release from the Ventoy USB and changed the partitions of the image. I removed the swap and resized the root partition to 26 GB and it went perfectly fine. After that I booted up the CloneZilla Live and cloned the image to the USB drive. Until that actually everything went perfectly fine. But the problems started when I try to boot the USB on my server.</p>

<h3 id="problem-1">Problem 1:</h3>

<p>So the first problem I encountered is mdadm. First thing that showed up when I booted up my server was mdadm wasn’t detecting my RAID 1 and becouse of that fstab was failing to mount the RAID volume and OS wasn’t booting. To investigate the problem on the OS side I shutdown the server and plugged that USB back to my laptop and edited the fstab and commented it out. And after that it booted just fine if we don’t mind the mdadm errors.</p>

<h3 id="problem-2">Problem 2</h3>

<p>The second and the biggest problem was the server was slow. In any terms it was very slow. For some reason when I boot the USB on my Laptop via the USB 3.0 port it runs perfectly fine but on server it was slow as hell. And that was leading systemD to go crazy. Booting it up were takes 2 minutes and even logging on over the TtY were almost impossible. It was leading the OS to crash after waiting for 5 minutes.</p>

<p>These were the 2 problem I was having and since I already had 3 days of downtime I wanted to give up on it and just keep a backup of the drive on my laptop and do a reinstall of the OS when it’s time has come. But for now it works perfectly fine and on programming world we have term. If it works, don’t fix it.  And this is what I’m going to do.</p>

<p>Since the day we had that earthquakes, everyday I do loose my mind more and more guys what I mean by that is before that earthquake I had great ideas inside my head and was planning to make them real.
The 5th Febuary was a great day it was a sunny day on the Malatya and the school was about to start on it’s exiting new season. At the last hours of that night I was planned everything perfectly on and wrote them onto my notebook. The notebook that I was writing my stuff before putting them into Evernote and stuff. Everything was great and at 11pm we all got our beds and had a sleep. That sleep was the worst sleep I ever got. I wasn’t know it’s reason until the 04:17 am comes. I woke up every 30 minutes for no reason and had a small amount of fear inside. I woke up for one last time. I remember it very detailed, it was 04:07 I woke up get to kitchen and drank a bottle of glass and than get into my bed and started to look my phone. And than I started to hear a noise. A noise that increases and moments later the earthquake has began. It wasn’t big at the begginning but than it got bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and it kept getting bigger and bigger until it ends. Our walls and stuff has fell of at that first strike and building stayed in it’s place. After that we quickly left the building and got into our car. And than a second one happened, it was smaller than the first one but it was enough for our building and some surrounding buildings to collapse… I just don’t want to continue on that. We were just happy for that we were survived and left the building on time. Than we left the city, moved into Nevşehir and I’m still up and running.</p>

<p>After that disaster I got addicted to things like watching Youtube videos, Instagram Reels and etc… I don’t have any energy to do anything like even writing this blogpost guys. I normally write this out in like 1 hour but it took me 3 days to write and publish this post. Becouse my mind is just a pile of nothing these days, I do feel like a computer that’s running without a CPU installed. I don’t know how to overcome this situation and I really need help for that. Hopefully I’ll write another blogpost soon that says I got recovered and happy the old Batuhan is back! But for now I’m just there standing with nothing. Just a body without a working brain.</p>

<p>That was it guys. I just wanted to update that 1 reader of my blog. As I said I’m still trying to recover in a safe and secure place. If you want to help me you can always send me a mail over the <a href="mailto://batuhan@thebatuhansnetwork.xyz">batuhan@thebatuhansnetwork.xyz</a> address and maybe <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bthyilmaz">buy me a coffee</a> any help would be apriciated. As always see you in the next blogpost!</p>

<p><img src="https://archive.thebatuhansnetwork.xyz/Media/Images/blog/Screenshot%202023-01-26%20at%2023.58.40.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Like that. 
So to do that I used a script named openring to do that. openring is a simple script that creates webrings using the RSS feeds. It fetches the RSS feeds that you’ve provided and creates an html file that you can place  into includes folder. So let’s go a step by step on how you can do that.</p>

<h3 id="1--install-go">1 ) Install go</h3>

<p>So this script has written in go and before start using it you have to compile it using go. I’m currently on macOS and gonna show the macOS way. But if you’re on a different OS than me you can go to https://go.dev/dl/ page and download the right binary for your OS. 
I’m going to use the macPorts to install the go into my system. To install it use the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo port install go</code> and wait for it. After that you can get into step 2.</p>

<h3 id="2--clone-openring-and-build-it">2 ) Clone openring and build it</h3>

<p>Now open your terminal again and clone the openring using the command down below.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/openring &amp;&amp; cd openring
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>After that command is done, run the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">go build</code> command and wait for it. After it’s done, you can continue to step 3.</p>

<h3 id="3--use-the-openring">3 ) Use the openring</h3>

<p>And here is the step that we’re going to use the openring. Using it is very simple.</p>

<p><img src="https://archive.thebatuhansnetwork.xyz/Media/Images/blog/Screenshot%202023-01-27%20at%2000.21.39.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now in there you can see a file named in.html. This file is our template, you can edit this file for your site’s needs and have a much better look that fits into your site. Now we’re going to create a file named out.html that includes our posts using the openring. To create that file you can use the command I put down below.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>openring \
-s https://www.joelchrono12.xyz/feed.xml \ 
-s https://andy-bell.co.uk/feed \ 
-s https://kevquirk.com/feed.xml \
&lt; in.html \
&gt; out.html 
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This command takes the in.html, adds 3 sources I placed and outputs it as the out.html. You can change these feeds as you like these are the ones that I’ve added to my site.</p>

<p>So now it’s time to switch into jekyll part.</p>

<p>Now in order to add our webring to our Jekyll blog. This part is really simple. 
So now place the out.html file that you just created into _includes folder inside your jekyll blog and after that go to your _layouts folder and open the post.html file.  After that place the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">% include out.html %</code> line under the main tag.</p>

<p><img src="https://archive.thebatuhansnetwork.xyz/Media/Images/blog/Screenshot%202023-01-27%20at%2000.42.42.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Like in that picture. And you’re done.</p>

<p>I hope this post helps to everyone who wants to use openring on their own blog site. I wrote that blogpost while I’m so sleepy and I’m sorry for any mistakes I had.</p>

Actually I had been considering to write a blogpost on that topic for some time. When I came across with The Verge’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513418/bring-back-personal-blogging">this post</a> about bringing the blogging back and its importance for the internet. I decided to write my troughs on that.</p>

<p>The post from The Verge mostly talks about how it was before the introduction of the Web 2.0 and how people were connected to each other with these blogs. I won’t gonna talk about that on this post becouse I was born in 2005 and my first internet usage was at the 2012. In these days the only place I knew was the Youtube and the Facebook. And becouse of that I don’t know or remember anything from that era. But I think that having a personal blog is a much better for sharing your story or your creations and here is my reasons for that.</p>

<h2 id="1--youre-the-only-owner-of-your-content">1 ) You’re the only owner of your content</h2>

<p>So when you create your blog site using simple tools like <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> or <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and host it on <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> or <a href="https://codeberg.page">Codeberg Pages</a>, you’re the owner. You’re completely free with your content, and no one other than you has any control over it. On platforms like Twitter, you’re not actually the owner of your account or the content you share. When something happens, it could get deleted for some “reasons,” and recovering that deleted content could be a huge pain.</p>

<h2 id="2--its-better-than-micro-blogging-for-sharing-content">2 ) It’s better than Micro blogging for sharing content</h2>

<p>With the intoduction of the Twitter in 2006, people met with a new term named micro blogging. It had less characters than a typical blogpost and aimed for sharing tiny things like a small update on your project or sharing what you’re doing on that exact moment. Not suitable for sharing articles or stories. Yes there is people sharing chains of tweets to tell big stories but that actually makes reading that story of the article less readable. Switching trough the posts and trying to find the next part of the chain isn’t optimal. For example we’re currently in the 2204th character and imagine reading that from a 250 character limited thread …</p>

<p>These were the 2 main reasons why personal blogs should make a comeback. Creating a blog is a really easy task and if you have cool stories to tell us, why not <a href="https://startafuckingblog.com">start your own blog</a> in 2023?</p>

Before starting that tutorial I should say that what works for me may not work for you, so please think before following these steps, in any case you can always come to our <a href="https://discord.gg/5p27ZdzQzF">discord server</a> from the About page and get more help from there. So without any further words lets go.</p>

<h2 id="why-im-creating-this-blogpost-its-just-too-easy">Why I’m creating this blogpost it’s just too easy.</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I can hear you saying that becouse it’s really easy to create a certificate and use with your domain when it comes to the Cloudflare and Cloudflare Tunnel. When you enable it from the Cloudflare dashboard, it encrypts everything for you, and it just works generally. But when it comes to hosting my web archive using Apache 2 with zero extra configuration, things become a bit problematic with resulting in mixed content and a website that doesn’t work.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://archive.thebatuhansnetwork.xyz/Media/Images/blog/Screenshot%202022-04-02%20at%2010.53.34.png" alt="Mixed content error" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>The error that you’re currently seeing above this text was the main reason why I didn’t had HTTPS until now. At the beginning I was tried everything at the Cloudflare side to fix it but nothing has worked until I realised that main problem was at the server side. As I said at the beginning of the post, the server side was just a zero configration apache2 installation and was using the http protocol. And this was a problem for the Cloudflare and the browsers becouse while the main content is being served as https other stuff as well as the files and medias was still on the http and this was the problem.</li>
  <li>The fix was actually too simple and after fixing it just inside 3 minutes I just kept thinking “Why the fuck I wasn’t knew that before!?”.  But yeah I fixed it in the end :).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-did-i-fix-it">How did I fix it?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>So let’s come to the part where contains the fix. It’s very simple and as I said before it only takes like 3 minutes to fix it. So here is the step by step guide:</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 1 - Update the apache2 and OpenSSL into latest version avabile:</p>

<ol>
  <li>First you have to make sure that you have the latest version of the Apache2 and OpenSSL installed on your server just in case and for that just use the commands below to update them to latest version.
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 openssl
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Step 2 - Generate your certificates from Cloudflare Dashboard</p>

<ol>
  <li>Now go to your Cloudflare Dashboard and login. After that select your domain and go to the SSL/TLS section from the sidebar.
<img src="https://archive.thebatuhansnetwork.xyz/Media/Images/blog/Screenshot%202022-12-02%20at%2022.58.50.png" alt="" />
 In this page select the Full encryption for the best result.</li>
  <li>After enabling the encryption go to the origin server section from the sidebar and create a certificate for your server. This certificate is gonna be used for the HTTPS and vertification of our server by the Cloudflare Tunnel.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://archive.thebatuhansnetwork.xyz/Media/Images/blog/Screenshot%202022-12-02%20at%2023.04.33.png" alt="" /></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>To create your certificate  press on the Create Certificate button and follow the pages.

![](https://archive.thebatuhansnetwork.xyz/Media/Images/blog/Screenshot%202022-12-02%20at%2023.04.48.png)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Press to the create button at the bottom and you should be able to see the page below.</p>

<p><img src="https://archive.thebatuhansnetwork.xyz/Media/Images/blog/Screenshot%202022-12-02%20at%2023.06.08.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now Cloudflare gives us 2 very random looking text outputs over there, the top one is your public certificate and the bottom one is your private key. Please make sure you saved them locally to your computer before pressing to the blue button, becouse as the name suggests the private key is private and Cloudflare doesn’t stores it for you and you won’t be able to see it again. And you have to save it to somewhere you know becouse it’s needed for HTTPS.
Now after creating your certificate and saving it on somewhere safe on your computer, it’s time to log into our server and configure the apache2.</p>

<p><img src="https://archive.thebatuhansnetwork.xyz/Media/Images/blog/Screenshot%202023-01-04%20at%2012.25.18.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now change your dir into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/apache2</code>and create a folder named Certificates with the command below</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd /etc/apache2 &amp;&amp; mkdir certificates
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>After that place the certificates that you’ve saved your computer to that folder. The important thing is do not save the public and private key into same file! I suggest you to save the public key as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">domain.key.pub</code> and the private key as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">domain.key</code>.  This will make managing your certificates for the different websites if you’re hosting multiple sites on the same machine like me.</p>

<p><img src="https://archive.thebatuhansnetwork.xyz/Media/Images/blog/Screenshot%202023-01-23%20at%2022.33.27.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And now, the only thing has left is to add these certs to our  websites and it’s actually very easy.
First you have to enable the ssl plugin of the apache and than add these certs to our website’s config file. 
To enable the Apache2’s ssl and rewrite plugin use the command I put down below.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo a2enmod ssl &amp;&amp; sudo a2enmod rewrite
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>after running that command go to your websites config and add these 3 lines to your config.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>SSLEngine on
SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/certs/&lt;your-cert.crt&gt;
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/certs/&lt;your-key.key&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Make sure that these lines are placed under the VirtualHost tag, otherwise Apache won’t gonna use our certs and we’ll end with the same situation which we don’t want. So after that it’s done. Now restart the Apache and you’re ready to go!</p>

<p>This is how I get my https working on my server with Cloudflare Tunnel and apache2 I hope this post helps to you in any case you can always come to our <a href="https://discord.gg/5p27ZdzQzF">discord server</a> and get more help from there.</p>
